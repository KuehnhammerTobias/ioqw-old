# ioid3-qw 

**A second breath of life for Xreal, based on Zack Middleton's ioq3ztm engine**

ioid3-qw is based on ioq3ztm. ioq3ztm was created by Zack Middleton to be a better (or alternative) base engine for developing new standalone id Tech 3 games. ioq3ztm, and therefore also ioid3-qw, is not compatible with any other id Tech 3 game. ioid3-qw also contains code from [Spearmint](http://spearmint.pw/) (the successor of ioq3ztm), and code from other repositories owned by [Zack Middleton](https://github.com/zturtleman?tab=repositories).
